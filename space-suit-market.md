<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Space Suit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IVA (Intravehicular Activity) Suit</li><li>EVA (Extravehicular Activity) Suit</li><li>IEVA (Intra/Extravehicular Activity) Suit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The space suit market consists of three main types: IVA (Intravehicular Activity), EVA (Extravehicular Activity), and IEVA (Intra/Extravehicular Activity) suits. IVA suits are worn inside the vehicle during spaceflight and provide comfort and mobility to astronauts. EVA suits, on the other hand, allow astronauts to venture outside the vehicle and perform tasks in the vacuum of space. IEVA suits combine features of both IVA and EVA suits, providing versatility for astronauts to carry out activities both inside and outside the spacecraft.</p></p>
