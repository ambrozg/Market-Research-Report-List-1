<p><p>In the baked dried strawberry market, the strawberries are washed, sliced, and then baked at a low temperature until they become dehydrated. This process gives them a chewy texture and retains most of their sweetness and flavor. On the other hand, in the freeze-dried strawberry market, the strawberries are frozen and then placed in a vacuum chamber where the frozen water content is removed through sublimation.
