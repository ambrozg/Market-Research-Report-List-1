<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Lubricant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lubricating Wax</li><li>Lubricating Oil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Die lubricants are substances used to reduce friction and wear between materials during the process of die casting. There are two main types: lubricating wax and lubricating oil. Lubricating wax is a solid lubricant that is applied in a melted state and provides a protective coating on the surface, reducing friction and preventing sticking. Lubricating oil, on the other hand, is a liquid lubricant that is applied in a thin layer and forms a boundary between the die and the metal, reducing friction and allowing for smooth movement during the casting process. These lubricants ensure the efficiency and durability of die casting operations.</p></p>
