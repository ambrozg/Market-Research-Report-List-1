<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underfills for CSP and BGA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Underfills for CSP (Chip Scale Package) and BGA (Ball Grid Array) markets can be categorized based on their viscosity, which refers to the thickness or flowability of the material. Low viscosity underfills have a thin consistency, allowing them to easily flow and fill the narrow gaps between the chips and substrate. This ensures effective adhesion and stress distribution, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the package. On the other hand, high viscosity underfills have a thicker consistency, which makes them suitable for applications requiring higher mechanical strength and improved thermal stability.</p></p>
