<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibodies</li><li>Polyclonal Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The primary antibody market consists of two main types: monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single clone of cells and are highly specific to a particular antigen. They are widely used in research and diagnostics. Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are produced from multiple clones of cells and recognize multiple epitopes of an antigen. They are also used for research and diagnostics but offer broader coverage compared to monoclonal antibodies. Both types play a crucial role in various applications such as immunology, cancer research, and infectious disease diagnosis.</p></p>
