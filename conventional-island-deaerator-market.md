<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional Island Deaerator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tray Type Deaerator</li><li>Spray Deaerator</li><li>Membrane deaerator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Conventional Island Deaerator market is categorized into three types: Tray Type Deaerator, Spray Deaerator, and Membrane Deaerator. Tray Type Deaerators remove dissolved gases by allowing steam to pass over perforated trays, effectively degassing the water. Spray Deaerators atomize the steam, creating a fine mist that effectively removes dissolved gases. Membrane Deaerators utilize a thin hydrophobic membrane to transfer dissolved gases from water to a vent chamber. These three types provide different methods for effectively removing dissolved gases from water in Conventional Island Deaerator systems.</p></p>
