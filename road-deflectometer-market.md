<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Deflectometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)</li><li>Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Road Deflectometer market consists of two main types: Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) and Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD). FWDs are robust devices used to measure pavement deflection under a dynamic load. They are commonly used for quality assessment and are capable of providing detailed pavement data. LWDs, on the other hand, are portable and lightweight instruments that measure deflection using a smaller load. They are used for quick pavement assessments and are suitable for smaller projects or areas where FWDs may be impractical. Both types of deflectometers play a crucial role in evaluating pavement conditions and ensuring road safety.</p></p>
