<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front and Rear Air-Conditioning (AC) Thermal Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop System</li><li>Closed Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Front and rear air-conditioning (AC) thermal systems are utilized in vehicles to regulate the temperature and provide comfort for passengers. Open-loop system refers to a design where the hot air from the engine is used to warm the cabin, while cold air outside is drawn in to cool the system. In contrast, closed-loop system recirculates the internal air and maintains a consistent temperature using a compressor and refrigerant. Both systems cater to different requirements, with open-loop relying on external temperature conditions, while closed-loop ensures a controlled environment within the vehicle.</p></p>
