<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium Foams Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex-situ Bonded Aluminium Foams</li><li>In-situ Bonded Aluminium Foams</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aluminium foams market consists of two main types: ex-situ bonded aluminium foams and in-situ bonded aluminium foams. Ex-situ bonded aluminium foams are produced by bonding the outer metallic skins with the foam core using various methods like adhesive bonding or welding. On the other hand, in-situ bonded aluminium foams are manufactured by injecting gas or blowing agents into the molten metal during the casting process, resulting in the formation of foam. Both types of aluminium foam offer unique characteristics and find applications in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and construction.</p></p>
