<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Variable Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Belt Connection</li><li>Chain Connection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) is a type of transmission system used in vehicles. There are two main types of CVT markets: belt connection and chain connection. In the belt connection market, the transmission uses a belt to transfer power between the engine and the wheels, providing smooth gear shifting. In the chain connection market, a chain is employed instead of a belt to achieve the same purpose. Both types of CVT offer efficient power transfer and a seamless driving experience, with the choice between them often dependent on the specific vehicle requirements.</p></p>
