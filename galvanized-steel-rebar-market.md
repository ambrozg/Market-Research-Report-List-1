<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li><li>Continuous Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized steel rebar market consists of two types: conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar and continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar. Conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar involves fully immersing the steel rebar in a bath of molten zinc to create a protective coating. Continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar, on the other hand, is processed in a continuous galvanizing line where the rebar is passed through a series of zinc baths to achieve the galvanized coating. Both types provide corrosion resistance to the rebar, improving its durability and lifespan.</p></p>
