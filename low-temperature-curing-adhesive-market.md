<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Temperature Curing Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Proof</li><li>Not Waterproof</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low temperature curing adhesive market can be categorized into two types: waterproof and not waterproof. Waterproof adhesive is specifically designed to create a moisture-resistant bond, making it suitable for applications in wet or humid environments. On the other hand, not waterproof adhesive does not provide the same level of resistance against moisture and is better suited for dry environments. Both types of adhesives offer low temperature curing properties, allowing them to bond materials at lower temperatures without requiring excessive heat.</p></p>
