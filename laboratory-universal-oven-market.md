<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Universal Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Convection</li><li>Forced Convection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Laboratory Universal Ovens are categorized into two types: Natural Convection and Forced Convection. Natural Convection ovens rely on the principle that heat rises, creating air circulation within the oven. This type is suitable for applications requiring gentle and uniform heating. Forced Convection ovens, on the other hand, use a fan or blower to circulate hot air evenly throughout the oven chamber, resulting in faster and more precise heating. They are often preferred for applications that require quick and efficient drying or heating processes.</p></p>
