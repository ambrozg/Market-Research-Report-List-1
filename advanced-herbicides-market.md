<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Herbicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Translocated Herbicides</li><li>Contact Herbicides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Advanced herbicides are classified into two main types: Translocated herbicides and Contact herbicides. </p><p>Translocated herbicides are absorbed by the leaves or stems of plants and then transported throughout the entire plant system. This type of herbicide kills both the visible part of the plant as well as the underground parts, such as roots and rhizomes, providing long-lasting control.</p><p>On the other hand, contact herbicides only affect the part of the plant that they come into direct contact with, typically the leaves and stems. These herbicides act quickly, killing the plant within a short period of time, but they may not provide effective control against underground plant parts.</p></p>
