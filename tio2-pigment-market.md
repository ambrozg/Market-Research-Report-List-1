<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TiO2 Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The TiO2 pigment market is divided into two main types: the sulfate process and the chloride process. The sulfate process involves the reaction of titanium ore with sulfuric acid, resulting in a white pigment that is commonly used in paints, plastics, and paper. On the other hand, the chloride process involves the use of chlorine gas to react with titanium ore, producing a more pure and brighter pigment. This process is typically used in applications where superior quality and performance are required, such as in coatings, cosmetics, and specialty products.</p></p>
