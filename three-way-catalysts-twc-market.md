<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-Way Catalysts (TWC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Precious Metal Three-Way Catalyst (Perovskite-type Oxides)</li><li>Precious Metal Three-Way Catalyst (Pt、Pd、Rh)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Three-way catalysts (TWC) are used in automotive exhaust systems to reduce harmful emissions. Non-precious metal TWCs, also known as perovskite-type oxides, are cost-effective alternatives to precious metal TWCs. They are composed of materials like cerium and zirconium that help convert nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons into less harmful substances. On the other hand, precious metal TWCs (Pt, Pd, Rh) are more efficient but expensive due to the high cost of the precious metals used. They offer superior conversion efficiency, ensuring cleaner exhaust emissions.</p></p>
