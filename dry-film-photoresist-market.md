<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive</li><li>Negative</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dry film photoresist market can be categorized into two types: positive and negative. Positive dry film photoresist is a type in which the exposed areas become insoluble and remain on the substrate, while the unexposed areas are dissolved during development. This type is commonly used in PCB manufacturing. On the other hand, negative dry film photoresist is a type in which the exposed areas become soluble and are washed away during development, leaving the unexposed areas on the substrate. It finds applications in the fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidics devices.</p></p>
