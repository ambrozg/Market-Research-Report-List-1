<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EVA Waxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-oxidized EVA waxes</li><li>Oxidized EVA wax</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EVA waxes are categorized into two types: non-oxidized EVA waxes and oxidized EVA waxes. Non-oxidized EVA waxes are produced without any exposure to oxygen during the manufacturing process. They have a higher melting point, making them suitable for applications requiring heat resistance, such as in adhesives or hot melt coatings. Oxidized EVA waxes, on the other hand, undergo an oxidation process that introduces oxygen during manufacturing. This lowers their melting point, making them ideal for applications like ink and paint additives, where lower viscosity is desired.</p></p>
