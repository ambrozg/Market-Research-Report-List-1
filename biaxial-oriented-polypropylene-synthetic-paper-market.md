<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biaxial Oriented Polypropylene Synthetic Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated BOPP Synthetic Paper</li><li>Uncoated BOPP Synthetic Paper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) Synthetic Paper is available in two main types: Coated BOPP Synthetic Paper and Uncoated BOPP Synthetic Paper. Coated BOPP Synthetic Paper has a thin layer of coating on its surface, which enhances its durability, printability, and water resistance. This type is commonly used for applications like labels, packaging, and signage. On the other hand, Uncoated BOPP Synthetic Paper lacks the additional coating layer, making it less durable and water-resistant. It is often used for applications where printability is not a priority, such as disposable products and single-use items. Both types cater to different market needs and find applications in various industries.</p></p>
