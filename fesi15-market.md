<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FeSi15 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Atomised Powder FeSi15</li><li>Milled Powder FeSi15</li></ul></p>
<p><p>FeSi15 refers to a ferrosilicon alloy consisting of approximately 15% silicon and 85% iron. There are two market types for FeSi15: atomised powder and milled powder. Atomised powder FeSi15 is produced by atomizing molten alloy, resulting in fine, spherical particles with good flowability and high reactivity. On the other hand, milled powder FeSi15 is achieved by mechanically milling solid alloy, leading to irregular-shaped particles. Both market types serve various industries, such as steel production, foundries, and chemical manufacturing, where FeSi15 is used as an alloying agent to enhance the properties of the final products.</p></p>
