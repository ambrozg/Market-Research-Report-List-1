<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiator Grilles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die Casting</li><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The radiator grilles market can be classified into three types: die casting, injection molding, and others. Die casting involves the use of molten metal, typically aluminum or zinc, which is poured into a mold and then cooled to form the grille. Injection molding, on the other hand, utilizes a plastic material that is heated and then injected into a mold to create the grille. The "others" category encompasses alternative manufacturing methods such as stamping, welding, or additive manufacturing techniques, which may be used to produce radiator grilles based on specific requirements.</p></p>
