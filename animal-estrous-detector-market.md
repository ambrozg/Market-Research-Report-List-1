<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Estrous Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired Detector</li><li>Wireless Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The animal estrous detector market consists of two main types: wired detectors and wireless detectors. Wired detectors require a direct physical connection to the animal or device being monitored, providing real-time data about the animal's estrous cycle. On the other hand, wireless detectors use modern technology to transmit data without the need for physical connection, allowing for more convenience and flexibility in monitoring. Both types serve the same purpose of accurately detecting and monitoring an animal's estrous cycle, but differ in the method of data transmission.</p></p>
