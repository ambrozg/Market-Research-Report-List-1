<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ground Deicing Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Solid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ground deicing chemicals are used to remove or prevent the formation of ice on airport runways, roads, and other ground surfaces. The market for these chemicals can be categorized into two types: liquid and solid. Liquid deicing chemicals, such as potassium acetate and potassium formate, are sprayed on the surface to break down existing ice and prevent further ice formation. Solid deicing chemicals, like calcium magnesium acetate and urea, are spread on the ground to melt ice and provide traction. Both types of chemicals play a crucial role in maintaining safe and ice-free surfaces during winter seasons.</p></p>
