<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue-gas Desulfurization Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry & Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment is used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from flue gases emitted by power plants and industrial processes. Wet FGD involves spraying a limestone slurry into the flue gas, where SO2 reacts with the slurry to form calcium sulfite. Dry FGD utilizes a specialized sorbent material, like lime or sodium bicarbonate, which is injected into the flue gas to capture and remove sulfur dioxide. Semi-dry FGD combines elements of both wet and dry processes by injecting a fine mist of sorbent into the flue gas stream.</p></p>
