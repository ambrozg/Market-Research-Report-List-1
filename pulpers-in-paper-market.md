<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulpers in Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrapilper</li><li>Drum Hydrapulper</li><li>Broke Pulper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pulpers play a crucial role in the paper industry for the efficient recycling of different types of waste paper. A hydrapulper is a type of pulper that uses mechanical and hydraulic forces to break down wastepaper into pulp. Drum hydrapulpers, on the other hand, employ a rotating drum to disintegrate the paper fibers. Broke pulpers specifically handle the recycling of broke paper, which refers to paper that has been damaged during production. These pulpers contribute to resource conservation, waste reduction, and the production of high-quality recycled paper products.</p></p>
