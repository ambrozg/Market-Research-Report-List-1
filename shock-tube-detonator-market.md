<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shock Tube Detonator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Tube Detonator</li><li>Single Tube Detonator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The shock tube detonator market is primarily divided into two types: dual tube detonators and single tube detonators. A dual tube detonator consists of two independent shock tubes, designed to ignite separate explosive charges simultaneously. This type is commonly used in applications where simultaneous detonation is required, such as mining operations. On the other hand, a single tube detonator includes only one shock tube, used to initiate a single explosive charge. This type is employed in various industries, including construction, quarrying, and demolition, where simultaneous detonation is not necessary.</p></p>
