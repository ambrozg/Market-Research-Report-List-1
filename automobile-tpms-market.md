<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automobile TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) market consists of two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors installed inside each tire to measure the tire pressure and temperature, sending the data to the vehicle's onboard computer. This enables the driver to receive real-time tire pressure readings. On the other hand, Indirect TPMS does not use sensors but relies on the vehicle's anti-lock braking system to monitor tire pressure through wheel speed sensors. It compares the rotational speed of each tire to detect any deviations caused by underinflated tires.</p></p>
