<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiovascular Fluoroscopy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With C-arm</li><li>With Table</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiovascular fluoroscopy systems are medical devices used in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases. There are two main types available in the market: with C-arm and with table. With C-arm systems consist of a moveable C-shaped arm that allows flexible positioning of the X-ray source and detector around the patient's body. This enables better visualization of blood vessels and structures during procedures. With table systems, the patient lies on a table that moves through the X-ray machine. Both types of systems aid in guiding interventions and providing real-time imaging during cardiovascular procedures.</p></p>
