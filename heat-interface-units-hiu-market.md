<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Interface Units (HIU) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect HIU</li><li>Direct HIU</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Heat Interface Units (HIU) are devices used in district heating systems to provide heating and hot water to multiple properties from a centralized heat source. Indirect HIUs have separate primary and secondary circuits, with a heat exchanger transferring heat from the primary system to the secondary system. This ensures no direct contact between the primary and secondary circuits. Direct HIUs, on the other hand, have a direct connection between the primary and secondary circuits, eliminating the need for a heat exchanger. Both types have their advantages and are used in different scenarios based on specific requirements.</p></p>
