<p><p>A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind, blend, and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel, stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as manganese steel or rubber.</p><p>The ball mill for mining market is expected to witness growth during the forecast period (2021-2027) due to several factors. Firstly, the increasing demand for metal and minerals globally is driving the growth of the mining industry, which in turn is boosting the demand for ball mills.
