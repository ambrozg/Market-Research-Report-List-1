<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IoT Smart Ultrasonic Proximity Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Beam</li><li>Retro-Reflective</li><li>Diffuse</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The IoT Smart Ultrasonic Proximity Sensors market includes three main types: Through-Beam, Retro-Reflective, and Diffuse. Through-Beam sensors consist of separate transmitters and receivers, where the signal is transmitted between them. Retro-Reflective sensors use a reflector to bounce the emitted signal back to the sensor. Diffuse sensors emit a signal and measure the reflection off the object itself. All of these types are designed to detect the presence or absence of objects, but they differ in their setup and applications in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and food processing.</p></p>
