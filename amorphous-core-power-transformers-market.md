<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Amorphous Core Power Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-immersed</li><li>Dry-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Amorphous core power transformers come in two main market types: oil-immersed and dry-type. Oil-immersed transformers are filled with insulating oil to provide better cooling and insulation, making them suitable for high-power applications. They are commonly used in industrial settings. Dry-type transformers, on the other hand, do not require oil for cooling and insulation. They use solid insulation materials and are safer for indoor use as they do not pose a risk of oil leakage or fire. Dry-type transformers are commonly found in residential and commercial buildings.</p></p>
