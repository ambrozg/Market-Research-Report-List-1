<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Borne Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One Component System Solvent Borne Coatings</li><li>Two Component System Solvent Borne Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent Borne Coatings are a type of coating that uses a solvent as its main carrier. Within this market, there are two main types: one component system solvent borne coatings and two component system solvent borne coatings. </p><p>One component system solvent borne coatings consist of a single component that is ready to use straight from the container. These coatings do not require any additional mixing or catalyzing agents and are typically applied in a single step process.</p><p>On the other hand, two component system solvent borne coatings require the mixing of two separate components, typically a base and a curing agent, before application. This mixing process activates the coating and initiates the curing process, resulting in a more durable and long-lasting finish.</p><p>Both one component and two component system solvent borne coatings have their own advantages and are used in different applications depending on the desired outcome.</p></p>
