<p><strong>The Mining Locomotive Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underground Mining</li><li>Open-Cast Mining</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mining locomotive market caters to the needs of underground and open-cast mining sectors. Underground mining involves extracting minerals or resources from beneath the Earth's surface through tunnels and shafts. Mining locomotives are used in this application to transport materials, equipment, and miners to different parts of the mine. Open-cast mining, on the other hand, involves large-scale surface excavation and requires locomotives for hauling earth, waste, and minerals. The market for mining locomotives serves both these mining methods by providing efficient transportation solutions in these challenging environments.</p></p>
